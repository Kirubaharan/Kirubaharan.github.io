# Why use open source tools?
Most of the open source tools are free to use, which makes them easy to install and learn. It could be shared with end users of research with ease. Sharing our work, reproducibility, and including new features are greatly enhanced by the open source nature of tools.

# What about the learning curve?
In my personal experience , I found it easier to learn open source tools rather than properitery tools. Because of Internet, tons of tutorials, [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), [Github](https://github.com), I was able to learn open source tools along with encouragment from working environment.

# How I got it into the open source world?
I have tried Ubuntu during my undergrad days but didnt relied on it for my work. During my masters programme, I was using mainly QGIS for my thesis work. I got frustrated with the frequent crashes of my laptop, So I switched to Ubuntu and started using open source tools for my research. After that I didnt looked back, as of now I rely only on open source tools for my research work related to hydrology.

# List of Tools I use:

|Name | Type | Function|
|-----|------|---------|
|Ubuntu| OS |  |
|QGIS | GIS | gis work|
|Python| Language| Data analysis and hydrolgical models|
|Latex | Language | Preparation of manuscripts, poster|
|R | Language | I use it less now after learning Python|
|Open Refine|  | cleaning the data|

# Why this blog ?
I want to document my workflow and also want to share using open source tools in research work.
